**Turning personal goals into measurable social impact.**

Meta Solidária is an open-source social impact platform that transforms personal discipline into collective generosity.

Groups — friends, residential communities, companies, and fitness teams — set measurable goals (such as weight loss or healthy habits) and convert achievements into real-world donations.

Every milestone reached becomes food, clothing, or essential supplies donated to local institutions.
